    <h1>MarineGuard Use Instructions</h1>
    <h2>maybe useful?</h2>
    <a id="bold">As you know, MarineGuard was engineered to perfection by professionals. Just look how majestic it is, obviously it was created by experienced frontend developers.</a><br>
    <h3>Panning and Zooming</h3>
    <a>You can pan and zoom. Good luck</a><br>

    <a>Hover over a red are to see tips for a specific zone (there's a whole 2 zones currently!!!!)</a><br>
    <img width="300px" src="tip1.png"><br>
    <a>You can also optionally use your eyes and brain to read the text that appears!!!<br>These tips let you know restrictions in an area to help protect it.</a>

    <h3>Change Background Color</h3>
    <a>1. Go to Options tab, and look at the only option there (probably should have called it "Option" instead.)<br>2. Change color, or reset to default color. It saves change to a cookie that expires in 30 days.<br>3. Go back to 'Map' tab, and see your astonishing new color (my personal favorite is yellow).</a><br>
